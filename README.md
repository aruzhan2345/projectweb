## Project Overview

**AituCritic** is a modern, responsive movie review platform that allows users to:
- Browse and search for movies.  
- View detailed movie information (poster, trailer, description, genres, director, composer, external ratings).  
- Add personal reviews (name, text, star rating) and see paginated review lists.  
- Manage a personalized Watchlist.  
- Sign up / log in, with localStorageâ€“based authentication and profile customization (avatar & nickname).  
- Contact support via an interactive form and browse a FAQ section.  

The platform uses semantic HTML, CSS (Flexbox/Grid), media queries, and vanilla JavaScript (Fetch API) for dynamic content and interactivity.
